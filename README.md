## Description

This is a env3d specific candy to allow programs using env3d examples to transpile. The actual
env3d javascript library is re-written in Three.js/WebGL and can be found at 
https://github.com/env3d/env3d-js.

To use this, make sure you change the pom.xml file to copy the final jar to the correct
location.
